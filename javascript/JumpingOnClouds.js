There is a new mobile game that starts with consecutively numbered clouds. 
Some of the clouds are thunderheads and others are cumulus. The player 
can jump on any cumulus cloud having a number that is equal to the 
number of the current cloud plus 1 or 2. The player must avoid the
thunderheads. Determine the minimum number of jumps it will take 
to jump from the starting postion to the last cloud. It is always
possible to win the game.

For each game, you will get an array of clouds numbered if they are safe or if they must be avoided.

Example

clouds = [0,1,0,0,0,1,0]
